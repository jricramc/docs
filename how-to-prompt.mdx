## The golden rule

**Be concise and specific.** Tell Nerd exactly what you need in as few words as possible, while including all the important details.

<Warning>
  **Never** take your prompt to ChatGPT and ask it to "make it better." This usually makes prompts worse by adding unnecessary fluff. Your direct, clear description is what Nerd needs.
</Warning>

## Good prompts are concise and complete

Less is more, but don't leave out critical details.

<CodeGroup>

```text ✅ Good
"Create an online store for handmade jewelry with product categories, 
shopping cart, and Stripe payment integration"
```

```text ❌ Too vague
"Build me a store"
```

```text ❌ Too wordy
"I would like to request the development of a comprehensive e-commerce 
solution that encompasses various features and functionalities for the 
purpose of selling handmade jewelry items..."
```

</CodeGroup>

## What to include in your prompt

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. What you're building" icon="bullseye">
    Start with the core purpose in one sentence.
    
    Examples:
    - "A CRM for managing real estate clients"
    - "An inventory management system for a warehouse"
    - "A booking platform for fitness classes"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="2. Key features" icon="list-check">
    List the must-have features clearly and directly.
    
    Example:
    "Include user authentication, appointment scheduling, payment processing, and email notifications"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="3. Important constraints" icon="shield">
    Mention any specific requirements or limitations.
    
    Examples:
    - "Must work on mobile"
    - "Should support multiple languages"
    - "Needs to handle 1000+ products"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="4. User roles (if applicable)" icon="users">
    Specify who will use the platform and what they can do.
    
    Example:
    "Two user types: customers who can browse and order, and admins who can manage inventory and view reports"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prompt templates

Use these templates as starting points:

### For e-commerce platforms

Must work on mobile and support guest checkout."
```

### For business tools

```text

```

## Common mistakes to avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Don't overthink it" icon="brain">
    Your first instinct is usually right. Write what you need and submit it.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Don't use ChatGPT" icon="ban">
    AI-generated prompts add fluff that confuses Nerd. Use your own words.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Don't write essays" icon="file-lines">
    Long paragraphs hide important details. Be direct and structured.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Don't assume Nerd knows" icon="question">
    If something is important to you, mention it explicitly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Examples of great prompts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Online marketplace" icon="store">
    ```
    "Create a marketplace for local services. Service providers can 
    create profiles and list their offerings. Customers can search by 
    location, book services, and leave reviews. Platform takes 15% 
    commission on bookings."
    ```
    
    **Why it's good:** Concise, covers all key features, includes business model details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Internal tool" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    ```
    "Build an employee directory with departments, contact info, and 
    org chart. Add a search function and let admins update employee data. 
    Export to CSV needed."
    ```
    
    **Why it's good:** Clear purpose, specific features, includes a technical requirement.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content platform" icon="newspaper">
    ```
    "Create a blog platform where writers can publish articles with 
    rich text formatting. Include categories, tags, comments, and an 
    admin dashboard for moderation. Readers can follow writers."
    ```
    
    **Why it's good:** Explains user roles, lists features clearly, describes interactions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Refining your platform

If Nerd's first attempt isn't quite right, tell it what to change:

<CodeGroup>

```text Adjusting features
"Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page"
```

```text Changing layout
"Move the navigation to the left sidebar instead of the top"
```

```text Fixing issues
"The mobile menu isn't closing when I select an item"
```

```text Adding details
"In the product page, show related items at the bottom"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Remember:** You're having a conversation with Nerd. Start with your core idea, see what it builds, then refine from there.
</Tip>

## Payment integration

Nerd uses **Stripe** for payment processing. You don't need to mention Stripe explicitly in your prompts - just say "payment processing" or "checkout" and Nerd will handle the integration automatically.

## Quick checklist

Before submitting your prompt, ask yourself:

- [ ] Can I read this in under 30 seconds?
- [ ] Have I mentioned all the features that matter to me?
- [ ] Is it written in my own words (not AI-generated)?
- [ ] Would someone unfamiliar with my idea understand it?

If you answered yes to all four, you're ready to build!
